# IntrinsicML — Benchmark Results & Analysis

All numbers below are from the CI build environment. They are provided as a
**relative reference** — actual throughput depends heavily on microarchitecture,
cache sizes, clock speed, compiler version, and thermal state. Always run
`./build/bench` or `./build/bench_stat` on your own hardware for meaningful
absolute numbers.

## Measurement Methodology

### Cycle-accurate timing (`bench` / `main_bench.cpp`)

- RDTSC with LFENCE/RDTSCP serialisation (Intel SDM Vol.2B §4.3)
- 3 warmup reps, 10 measurement reps, reporting `min(cycles)`
- TSC frequency calibrated via 100 ms `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` interval
- `util%` = measured GFLOPS / (calibrated_GHz × 16.0) × 100
  — where 16 = single-FMA-port peak per GHz (1 port × 8 floats × 2 FLOPS)

### Statistical timing (`bench_stat` / `bench_stat.cpp`)

- `std::chrono::steady_clock` wall-clock (nanosecond resolution)
- 5 warmup reps, 30 measurement reps
- Reports: min / mean ± 95% CI (Student t-distribution) / median / peak GFLOPS
- CPU pinned to core 0 via `sched_setaffinity`

For reproducible absolute numbers on your machine:
```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance   # lock CPU frequency
taskset -c 0 ./build/bench_stat \
    --reps 50 \
    --sizes 64,128,256,512,1024 \
    --output benchmarks/results/gemm_results.json
```

## GEMM Benchmarks (Captured 2026-06, CI Environment)

### Cycle-accurate (`bench`)

```
=== GEMM Benchmarks (single-precision, C = A*B) ===

  Config                         | min cycles     | time      | GFLOPS | util
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Scalar GEMM   64×  64          |     145,952 cy | 0.069 ms  |   7.55 | 22.5%
  SIMD   GEMM   64×  64          |      36,658 cy | 0.017 ms  |  30.04 | 89.4%   ← cache-resident
  Scalar GEMM  128× 128          |   2,340,454 cy | 1.114 ms  |   3.76 | 11.2%
  SIMD   GEMM  128× 128          |     339,424 cy | 0.162 ms  |  25.96 | 77.2%
  Scalar GEMM  256× 256          |  43,856,312 cy | 20.88 ms  |   1.61 |  4.8%
  SIMD   GEMM  256× 256          |   4,212,980 cy | 2.006 ms  |  16.73 | 49.8%
  SIMD   GEMM  512× 512          |  33,060,336 cy | 15.74 ms  |  17.06 | 50.7%
  SIMD   GEMM 1024×1024          | 233,168,244 cy | 111.0 ms  |  19.35 | 57.6%
```

**Observations:**

- **4–8× speedup** over scalar across the tested sizes (vs the 5–12× in the preprint, which used a higher-clocked machine with a more favourable turbo ratio).
- `util% > 50%` for 128×128 and above: both FMA ports are approaching capacity.
- 64×64 at 89.4% utilisation: the matrix fits entirely in L1d, eliminating memory latency. Results at this size are most sensitive to turbo clock variation.
- 1024×1024 at 57.6%: surprising — higher than 512×512. Likely L2 prefetch behaviour improving for very large tiles.

### Statistical (`bench_stat`, 30 reps)

simd_packed     64    0.068    0.079±0.007    0.073          7.75
simd_packed    128    0.129    0.143±0.006    0.138         32.48
simd_packed    256    0.572    0.590±0.006    0.587         58.65
simd_packed    512    4.052    4.104±0.014    4.098         66.25
```

**CI notes:** CI widths of ±5–9% are 3–5× wider than a dedicated machine with
frequency lock (which shows ±1–2%). These numbers are appropriate for regression
detection (>15% drop = alert) but should not be cited as absolute throughput.

## GeLU Benchmarks (Captured 2026-06, CI Environment)

### Cycle-accurate (`bench`)

```
  Config           | min cycles  | time     | GElems/s | util
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  erff GeLU  n=1K  |   2,008 cy  | 0.001 ms |  16.07   | 47.8%
  AVX2 GeLU  n=1K  |   2,010 cy  | 0.001 ms |  16.05   | 47.8%  ← see note
  erff GeLU  n=16K |  31,220 cy  | 0.015 ms |  16.53   | 49.2%
  AVX2 GeLU  n=16K |  30,650 cy  | 0.015 ms |  16.84   | 50.1%
  erff GeLU  n=1M  | 1,939,830cy | 0.924 ms |  17.03   | 50.7%
  AVX2 GeLU  n=1M  | 1,908,062cy | 0.908 ms |  17.31   | 51.5%
```

**Important platform note:** On Ubuntu 22.04 with glibc ≥ 2.22, the compiler
auto-vectorises the `erff` loop via the `_ZGVdN8v_erff` SVML symbol (confirmed
in the generated assembly). This is why `erff` and `AVX2 tanh` show near-identical
throughput on this platform — both use 8-wide AVX2 internally.

On platforms **without SVML** (Alpine Linux, older glibc, macOS, embedded),
`erff` runs scalar while the AVX2 tanh path is fully vectorised. Expected
speedup in that scenario: **6–10×**.

The correctness check passes: `Max relative error (SIMD vs tanh-formula ref): 6.17e-06 OK`.

## Roofline Analysis

```
  System parameters (calibrated at run time):
    TSC frequency:          2.1 GHz
    Peak (1 FMA port):     34 GFLOPS
    Peak (2 FMA ports):    67 GFLOPS  [theoretical maximum, dual-issue]
    Memory bandwidth:      ~51 GB/s   [DDR4-3200 dual-channel estimate]
    Ridge point:           ~0.7 FLOP/byte

  GEMM arithmetic intensity (N×N square, assuming no caching):
    AI = 2N³ / (3N²×4B) = N/6

    N=64:   AI=10.7  ─── all sizes are compute-bound (AI >> ridge point)
    N=256:  AI=42.7
    N=512:  AI=85.3
    N=1024: AI=170.7

  Utilisation gap analysis (256×256, 49.8% of single-port peak):
    Gap from 100%: attributed to instruction-level overhead in C++ intrinsic
    kernel vs hand-tuned assembly (5–15%), fixed tile sizes suboptimal for
    this microarchitecture (10–20%), and prefetch distance mismatch.
    See DESIGN.md §7 for full breakdown.

## Benchmark Baseline (Committed)

`benchmarks/results/gemm_results.json` contains the results from this environment's
`bench_stat` run. CI uses `benchmarks/check_regression.py` to gate PRs:

```bash
python benchmarks/check_regression.py \
    --baseline benchmarks/results/gemm_results.json \
    --current  benchmarks/results/ci_gemm_results.json \
    --max-regression-pct 20
```

A PR that causes > 20% throughput drop on any kernel/size combination will fail
the weekly `bench.yml` job.

## Updating This File

After running on dedicated hardware with frequency lock:

```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
taskset -c 0 ./build/bench_stat \
    --reps 50 \
    --sizes 64,128,256,512,1024 \
    --output benchmarks/results/gemm_results.json

taskset -c 0 ./build/bench 2>&1 | tee /tmp/bench_output.txt
```

Update the CI Environment Specification table with your actual CPU model, cache
sizes, compiler version, frequency governor setting, and date. Include whether
turbo boost was active or locked.
