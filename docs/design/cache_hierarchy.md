# Cache Hierarchy and Tile Size Derivation

IntrinsicML's GEMM implementation explicitly targets all three cache levels.
The tile constants MC, KC, NC are derived to keep specific panels resident at
specific cache levels during the 5-loop computation.

## Cache Targets by Loop Level

| Loop | Panel | Fits in | Size (bytes) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Loop 2 (pc): K-tiles | Bc panel (KC × NC) | L2 | KC × NC × 4 = 256 × 8 × 4 = 8 KB |
| Loop 3 (ic): M-tiles | Ac panel (MC × KC) | L2 | MC × KC × 4 = 128 × 256 × 4 = 128 KB |
| Loops 4+5: register tiles | MR × NR accumulators | L1 / registers | 8 × 8 × 4 = 256 bytes |
| Loop 1 (jc): N-tiles | Bc stream | L3 | NC × K × 4 = 2048 × K × 4 |

The large NC=2048 in `avx2_gemm_packed.cpp` is intentional: B panels larger
than L2 are acceptable as long as they fit in L3, where streaming prefetch
latency (~40 cycles) is tolerable since the inner micro-kernel produces 8 FMAs/step
(≈ 4 cycles at full throughput) before the next B panel line is needed.

## Derivation: KC and MC for L2

For a dual-resident L2 target (both Ac and Bc fit together):

```
Ac panel size = MC × KC × 4 bytes
Bc panel size = KC × NC_small × 4 bytes  (NC_small = NR × n_blocks)

Target: Ac + Bc ≤ L2_size
  128 × 256 × 4 + 256 × 8 × 4 = 131072 + 8192 = 139264 bytes ≈ 136 KB

Typical L2 = 256 KB (Skylake) → 136 KB leaves comfortable headroom for
instruction cache, OS data, and speculative prefetch staging.
```

On Zen 4 (L2 = 1 MB) or Alder Lake (L2 = 1.25 MB per P-core), these tile
sizes are deeply L2-resident. A larger MC or KC could be used profitably on
those microarchitectures — this is listed in ROADMAP.md as future auto-tuning work.

## Alignment and Cache-Line Crossing

All packing buffers use 64-byte alignment (`cache_alloc.hpp`):

- 64 bytes = 1 cache line = 1 AVX-512 register
- `_mm256_load_ps` (aligned) has the same throughput as `_mm256_loadu_ps`
  (unaligned) on Haswell+, but unaligned access *can* cause extra load-port
  traffic when the load straddles a cache-line boundary
- The packing routines in `avx2_gemm_packed.cpp` guarantee that packed panel
  rows are cache-line aligned, so all inner-kernel B loads are guaranteed
  single-cache-line accesses

---

## Software Prefetching

The inner kernel issues `prefetch_l1` hints 4 iterations ahead in the K-loop:

```cpp
prefetch_l1(b_ptr + 4 * NR);   // pull next B panel chunk into L1
```

**Why 4 iterations?**
- Skylake L2→L1 fill latency ≈ 12 cycles
- Inner kernel processes 8 FMAs/iteration × 0.5 cy/FMA = 4 cycles/iteration
- 12 cycles ÷ 4 cycles/iter = 3 iterations minimum → 4 gives a safety margin

The prefetch hint is a *hint*, not a guarantee. On CPUs with a strong hardware
prefetcher (Ice Lake, Zen 3+), the software hint is usually redundant but harmless.
On older or lower-power cores it can provide a measurable throughput improvement.
