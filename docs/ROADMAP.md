---

## v0.8 — AVX-512 Full Kernel ✅

**Both GEMM kernels now have correct, tested, dispatched AVX-512 support:**

| Kernel | File | AVX2 tile | AVX-512 tile | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reference | `avx_matmul.cpp` | 6×16 (12 YMM) | 6×32, dual `__m512`/row (12 ZMM) | ✅ |
| Primary (Python-facing) | `avx2_gemm_packed.cpp` | 8×8 (8 YMM) | 8×16, single `__m512`/row (8 ZMM) | ✅ |

**Design note on the two different AVX-512 tile shapes:** the reference
kernel's 6×32 tile needed a genuine dual-accumulator split (two `__m512`
per row) because 32 columns exceeds one ZMM register's 16-float width —
this is exactly the design the disabled stub got wrong (see below). The
primary kernel's 8×16 tile needed no such split: one `__m512` already
spans the full 16-column width, so there is no "second half" to forget by
construction. Both were verified via standalone hand-computed unit-test
harnesses run on real AVX-512 hardware before being wired into their
respective dispatch paths, plus permanent forced-full-coverage regression
tests in `tests/test_gemm.cpp` and `tests/test_gemm_packed.cpp` that choose
M/N dimensions with zero possible edge/tail blocks — so a broken full-block
kernel cannot be masked by scalar-fallback correctness. Both pass under
AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer with zero findings.

**History — why this was previously disabled:** an earlier version of
`gemm_micro_6x32_avx512` declared a 32-wide tile but only ever loaded and
accumulated one `__m512` (16 floats) per row, silently leaving the upper 16
output columns untouched after a `beta=0` memset (i.e., silently zeroed).
That bug is why AVX-512 dispatch was disabled for an entire release cycle —
`inner_NR` was fixed at 16 (AVX2-only) regardless of detected hardware.

**Measured performance impact (primary Python-facing kernel, this environment):**

| N   | AVX2-only (previous) | AVX-512 (now) | Speedup |
|-----|----------------------|----------------|---------|
| 64  | 5.4 GFLOPS  | 6.4–6.6 GFLOPS  | ~1.15–1.2× |
| 128 | 26.9 GFLOPS | 30–35 GFLOPS    | ~1.1–1.3× |
| 256 | 54.9 GFLOPS | 64–66 GFLOPS    | ~1.15–1.2× |
| 512 | 58.4 GFLOPS | 73–74 GFLOPS    | ~1.25–1.3× |

These numbers were captured on a shared, unpinned CI sandbox with visible
run-to-run scheduler noise (see raw trial data in commit history); repeated
trials cluster consistently in the ranges shown above. **Why not closer to
2×** despite doubling SIMD width: panel packing and memory-movement overhead
are ISA-independent — only the inner FMA loop benefits from the wider
register, so overall speedup is bounded well below 2× by Amdahl's law. Run
`./bench_stat --sizes 64,128,256,512 --reps 50` with `sudo cpupower
frequency-set -g performance` and `taskset -c 0` on dedicated hardware for
tighter, more reproducible numbers.

**Remaining scope (not yet done):**
- [❌] Tile-size re-tuning for Sapphire Rapids / Zen 4 (larger L2, different
      port layout) — current MC/KC/NC constants were derived for Skylake-class
      caches and are not yet re-validated on newer AVX-512 microarchitectures.
- [❌] AVX-512 BF16/VNNI paths (separate from the FP32 work done here).

**Since resolved:** `isa=` (in `sgemm()` / `GEMMConfig`) now genuinely forces
a specific kernel per-call — `set_gemm_isa_override`/`get_gemm_isa_override`
(thread_local, RAII-guarded around each call so it never leaks into
subsequent calls) in `avx2_gemm_packed.cpp`, wired through
`pybind_entry.cpp`. Requesting `isa="avx512"` on hardware without
AVX-512F+DQ raises `RuntimeError` (checked against
`gemm_packed_avx512_hardware_available()`, also exposed to Python as
`simd_kernels.avx512_available()`). `isa="scalar"` is a recognized value
but raises `RuntimeError` ("not yet implemented") rather than silently
falling back, since no forced full-matrix scalar path exists yet. Verified
via a direct C++ test (`test_gemm_isa_override` in
`tests/test_gemm_packed.cpp`) that proves the override changes
`gemm_packed_isa_is_avx512()`'s return value in both directions — not
inferred from numeric equivalence, which could mask a broken override on
hardware where auto-detect and a forced choice happen to coincide.

---

## v0.9 — Additional Primitives (Planned)
- [❌] Skip panel packing below a size threshold (direct unpacked micro-kernel
      call for small N). Measured impact: IntrinsicML is at 3.9% of OpenBLAS
      at N=64 vs 55–59% at N≥256 — packing overhead dominates small-matrix
      GEMM and is not yet amortised. AVX-512 (§v0.8) barely moved the N=64
      number (3.7%→3.9%) precisely because this regime isn't FMA-throughput-
      bound. In fact, at N=64 `sgemm_packed` measures *slower* than a plain
      `-O3 -ffast-math`-compiled scalar triple loop (~0.7×) — the compiler's
      auto-vectorization of the naive reference has no packing overhead to
      pay, unlike the packed kernel. See `docs/BENCHMARKS.md §Positioning vs
      OpenBLAS` and `README.md §Performance` for the measurements that
      identified this.
- [❌] BF16 GEMM kernel (AVX-512 BF16, relevant for modern LLM inference)
- [❌] FP16 GEMM kernel (F16C extension)
- [✅] Vectorized `exp` via Cody–Waite (`fast_exp_avx2` in `simd_math.hpp`, shared by GeLU/SiLU/Softmax)
- [✅] Vectorized Softmax inner loop using fast exp approximation (`softmax_avx2.cpp` Pass 2)
- [❌] `FlashAttention`-style fused attention microkernel (research target)

---

## v1.0 — NUMA and Multi-socket (Planned)
- [❌] NUMA-aware packing buffer allocation
- [❌] Multi-socket OpenMP with NUMA-local thread-private buffers
- [❌] Benchmark against OpenBLAS multi-threaded on dual-socket systems

---

## GeLU Benchmark Platform Dependency

On Ubuntu 22.04+ with glibc ≥ 2.22, the compiler auto-vectorises loops
containing `erff()` via the `_ZGVdN8v_erff` SVML symbol. This means the scalar
`gelu_forward_scalar` (erff path) and `gelu_forward_avx2` (Cody–Waite tanh)
run at approximately the same throughput on this platform.

**This is not a bug.** On platforms without SVML (Alpine Linux, older glibc,
macOS, embedded targets), `erff` runs scalar and the AVX2 tanh path achieves
6–10× speedup. The AVX2 tanh path also avoids the `erff` function-call overhead
entirely, producing more predictable latency in inference pipelines.

**What this means for benchmarks:** The GeLU column in BENCHMARKS.md shows ~1×
speedup on CI (Ubuntu 22.04 runner). This is accurate for that environment.
On production servers running older glibc or containers based on Alpine, the
speedup will be in the 6–10× range.

## Known Honest Limitations (never remove this section)

These limitations are explicitly documented to help users understand the gap
between IntrinsicML and production BLAS libraries.

| Limitation | Impact | Planned fix |
|---|---|---|
| No hand-written assembly micro-kernel | 5–15% overhead vs hand-tuned assembly | Optional / long-term |
| Fixed tile sizes (MC/KC/NC) | Derived for Skylake-class caches; not re-tuned for Sapphire Rapids / Zen 4 | v0.9 auto-tune |
| Panel packing not skipped for small N | `sgemm_packed` is *slower* than a plain scalar loop at N=64 (~0.7×) — packing overhead dominates before it's amortised | v0.9 |
| Single-threaded default | Linear throughput scaling with cores uncaptured | OpenMP flag exists |
| No BF16/FP16 kernels | Modern LLM inference prefers lower precision | v0.9 |
| No NUMA-aware allocation | Throughput degrades on multi-socket systems | v1.0 |
